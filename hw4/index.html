		<h2>Overview</h2>
		This homework simulates a cloth with point masses and springs along with collision handling. Simulates 
		handling collisions with objects such as a sphere and the cloth itself, along with 
		texture mapping and shaders.

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		Below are images of the masses and springs of our wireframe with different constraints.

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		Below are images simulating the cloth with different parameters. Looking at the cloth with 
		low ks, we can see many folds at the top compared to the high ks cloth. This shows the cloth is 
		more flexible and stretchable when the spring constant is lower. When simulating, we can see the cloth 
		stretch up and down more compared to the high ks. When the cloth has a lower density, the cloth doesn't bend on the sides 
		compared to the cloth with higher density. This is because the cloth is being stretched down more by gravity due to how dense 
		it is as well as how the cloth falls faster due to how heavy it is. When the cloth has low damping, the cloth would continue to bounce up and down frantically
		due to losing less energy over time which means it keeps retaining most of its energy from the fall for it to go back up multiple times compared to high damping where the cloth 
		just falls like a hard paper without bouncing. Overall, compared to the original cloth, low ks means flexibibility, high ks, means more static, doesn't move as much, 
		low density leads to less mass on the cloth, high density drags the cloth down more due to how dense it is, low damping leads to more energy preserved after the fall, and high damping 
		loses all of its energy from the fall.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		For handling collisions with spheres and planes, we basically follow the directions in the spec. For spheres, 
		we get the vector from the point to the origin of the sphere and get the distance. If the distance is longer than the radius, then the 
		point is outside of the sphere so we do not have to worry about collisions. Otherwise, the point is inside or touching the sphere. From there
		we calculate the tangent point by extending our vector from the origin to the surface of the sphere where the point should return back to. Using
		the tangent point, we can get the correction vector such that the point's last position doesn't go into the sphere. We update the point's position to 
		be the sum of the last position and scaled correction vector due to friction. For colliding with a plane, we calculate the distance between the current and last position 
		of the point mass and the plane. Using the dot product of the vector and the normal, if it is positive, then it is above the plane, negative means below the plane.
		Therefore, if multiplying both the last and current position of the point gives us a negative number, then we know that the point went through the plane and needs to be corrected.
		Therefore we project the point mass position onto the plane to find the tangent point by finding the distance of the last position to the plane. 
		We get the correction vector by including a small offset for the small displacement and then calculate the new position similar as the sphere.
		Below are the cloths resting on the sphere using different ks values. We can see from the images that a lower ks value gives it more flexibility and stretchness so we can see more folds to the side
		of the sphere. Meanwhile, the higher the ks value, the less flexible and less folds are seen folding around the sphere. Below this is the shaded cloth 
		lying peacefully at rest on the plane.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		For handling self collisions, we use a spatial map or spatial hashing to sort point mass pairs that are close to each other. 
		First we calculate the hash position to map each point to its 3D box by using the given equations in the spec and generate a corresponding hashcode to put into the map, 
		This process is done for all point masses. To test for self collision for a single point mass, we generate the hashcode to find its close neighbors and retrieve the nearby 
		points. We then loop through all points masses that aren't the input point and check if they are within 2 * thickness distance apart. If so, we compute a correction vector that 
		is applied to the point mass and we do this for all nearby points. The final correction vector is then the average of all of these pairwise correction vectors and scaled down by simulation steps.
		Below we have a sample of the cloth falling on itself from the start to the end. Below this we simulate the folding on itself with different density and ks values. For a low density, the cloth produces wider and nice smooth folds compared 
		to the high density where the folds are smaller and bunched up do to how dense the cloth is. For low ks values, the cloth acts like the high density with crumpled folds and folds way too much compared to the higher ks fold 
		which has smoother and larger folds due to how unflexible it is.

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		A shader program is a colleciton of instructions that are ran on the GPU by telling how to process graphics data. In other words, 
		it runs the graphics pipeline which accelates frame rendering. This program contains both a fragment shader and vertex shader where it processes each vertex of a 3D model
		into screen coordinates and passes along data such as position, normals, and tangents. Then this is sent to the fragment shader where it computes the final color of each pixel by 
		applying lighting models and other effects like Blinn-Phong. The Blinn-Phong model is broken into three parts, the ambient component, the diffuse component, and the specular component. 
		For the ambient component, it gives the object a level of brightness even when not directly lit by a light source. This prevents certain parts of the scene to be pitch dark. 
		The diffuse component simulates the scattering of light when hit by a rough surface by using Lambert's law where the intensity of illumination decreases as the angle increases between the normal and light vectors. The specular 
		component gives the scene more glossy and shiny texture. Blinn-Phong combines these components to bring about a more realistic image that has both lighting, glossiness, shine, and reflection.
		Below are images of the cloth with diffeent components of Blinn-Phong as well as the combination of all three.

		Below are images of bump mapping and displacement mapping of the cloth and sphere with a new texture that was provided
		in the code. For bump mapping, it creates an illusion of the details on objects such that it is perceived to have bumps and details since we 
		changed the normal vector. We see that it appears that the cloth has bumps from the texture of the cloth even though the sphere and cloth have no bumps. Compared 
		with displacement mapping, the positions of the vertices are adjusted such that it incorporates vertex position changes. This gives the object a more bumpy surface for both 
		the cloth and sphere providing a true visual of bumps making it more realistic. For the 16 resolution and 128 resolution, there weren't that many details that can be seen changed for the bump 
		mapping image due to no changes in the vertex positions. However, for displacement mapping, we can see that the 16 resolution is has fewer bumps and more smooth compared to the 128 resolution 
		where we can see a lot of little small bumps and more detailed bumps giving us a better overall realistic feel of the displacement mapping bumps.
